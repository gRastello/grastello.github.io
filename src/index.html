  Currently I’m a master student in mathematics at UniTo (Turin, Italy).
  My main mathematical interests lie somewhere between Logic, Algebra and Category Theory.
  I also kinda of enjoy computer science, playing around with GNU/Linux, writing crappy code, ranting about free software and all that good stuff.
</p>

<p>
  I also have a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfWJa4oMN7dno23KdxoGSAw">youtube channel</a> where I make introductory videos on Category Theory in Italian (but I've been inactive for a while) and a <a href="blog.html">blog</a> because some times I like to write about things.
  This website also hosts a collection of <a href="notes.html">notes and other documents</a> on various topics (basically only math) that might be useful to someone else.
